Next:

- [ ] Add integration tests with kotlin compile tests (input: partial schema, output: compiling example)
- [ ] Fully working recursive type generation (+ root resource type and root function type)
- [ ] Clean up types and organize the code a bit better

Hard:

- [ ] model HCL2 language and convert it to Kotlin code (maybe YAML or JSON representation would be enough)

Other:

- [ ] Support for oneOf (Either?)
- [ ] Support for asset / archive
